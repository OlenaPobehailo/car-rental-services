# Car Rental Application

Welcome to Car Rental Application developed as a test project.

## Overview

The application consists of three pages:


### 1. Home Page
The home page serves as an introduction to services. Users will find a general overview of the car rental options available. 

### 2. Car Catalog Page
The car catalog page is designed to assist users in finding the perfect vehicle for their requirements. Here, users can browse through a diverse range of cars, each with varying specifications. The filtering options allow users to narrow down their search based on:

#### Brand: Filter cars by the manufacturer or brand.
#### Hourly Rental Price: Set a preferred price range for hourly car rental.
#### Mileage: Filter cars based on the distance traveled by the vehicle.

This page aims to provide a user-friendly interface, making it easy for customers to find a car that suits both their preferences and budget.

### 3. Favorites Page
The favorites page is a personalized space for users to view and manage the cars they have added to their favorites. Users can add cars to their favorites from the car catalog page, helping them keep track of the vehicles they are interested in renting. This feature enhances the overall user experience by providing a convenient way for users to revisit and finalize their rental choices.

## Technologies Used
